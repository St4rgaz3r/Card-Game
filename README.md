# Atexo Card Game

Françis, Majdi (or someone else), it's time to play the game! ♦︎ ♥︎ ♠︎ ♣︎

`First of all, you need to shuffle current deck (by clicking the "SHUFFLE DECK" button) to drop the 10 firsts cards in the blank area. Then click on "SORT CARDS" button to sort them!`

You can do this as many times as you want.
